Here are the steps that I have done in assignments.






1) In this project I have Made Login and Sign Up functionalities.
2) After that there is a profile screen to see the profile of the user and after that click on the add attempt button. 
3) After that I have made to take quiz functionalities based on categories like HTML Quiz, and React Quiz.
4) After taking Quiz I have made to Evaluate Result functionalities accordingly.
5) Now on the page ./admin we can see the admin profile, which is only for me user can't see.
6) On that admin page there is an option to add a quiz button
7) On reaching the ./addquiz page we can see a form to add quiz questions that only the admin user can do.
8) This site is fully responsive as well as code is well documented and can be viewed on mobile also(Bonus points).



Note : 

To see the admin page 
Search in the search bar
./localhost:3000/admin.
so in the ./admin page will get the admin profile but the user can't see the list of users below and also can't add quiz questions to it only the admin can do this


Note : 

To show all questions in the quiz I have made db.json files so that others can also see all the questions. But if I will change the GET URL to localhost then questions will fetch from the MongoDB database. But in other systems localhost did not have  questions for quizzes  in the database. Due to this reason, I have made db.json files.


Note : 

For questions in  db.json and finaldb.json, I have these questions from myself  so I feel good to add these questions for reference in this assignment.



Set up to run the code:

1) Open project with root directory in one folder in VsCode and in terminal, In terminal do these steps.
2) cd server
3) npm install
4) nodemon src/index.js
5) In another terminal.
6) cd client
7) npm install
8) npm start
9) Now frontend and backend will run in both terminals.
