Here are the steps which i have done in assignments.






1) In this project I have Made Login and Sign Up functionalities.
2) After that there is profile screen to see profile of user and after that click on add attempt button. 
3) After that i have made to take quiz functionalities based on categories like HTML Quiz , React Quiz.
4) After taking Quiz i have made to Evaluate Result functionalities accordingly.
5) Now on the page ./admin we can see admin profile , that is only for me user can't see.
6) In that admin page there is option to add quiz button
7) On reaching ./addquiz page we can see form to add quiz questions that only admin user can do.
8) This site is full responsive as well as code is well documented and can be view in mobile also(Bonus points).



Note : 

To see admin page 
search in search bar
./localhost:3000/admin.
so in ./admin page will get admin profile but user can't see list of users below and also can't add quiz questions to it only admin can do this


Note : 

To show all questions in quiz i have maked db.json files so that others can also see all questions.But if i will change GET url to localhost then questions will fetch from mongodb database. 
Due to this reason i have maked db.json files.
